Maybe all that weed did fuck me up huh. Anyway, I think I try and seek validation for many things including any sort of progress I've made with anything. Gonna try the Pomodoro Technique and see how shit works. but yeah lets try and see how long till i give up aigb qb. Got to make this shit big in the future.
